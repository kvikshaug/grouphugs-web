<h2>Bot control interfaces</h2>

<p>Earlier, we used to have a handy little web interface that would let you restart the bot, view the latest log entries and more. However, after moving the bot and getting this new setup, we haven't gotten this far yet. At this point, you'll just have to poke murr4y in <%= link_to "the channel", :controller => :about, :action => :us %> and let him know what you need.</p>

<p>We hope to be able to reimplement that functionality here soon.</p>
